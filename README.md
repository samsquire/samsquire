### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Are you looking for a devops software engineer? Send me an email.

I'm a devops software engineer with advanced skills in Python, Java, Javascript, Terraform. See my [personal-manifesto](https://github.com/samsquire/personal-manifesto). See my [wants repository](https://github.com/samsquire/wants) and [my dream for society](https://github.com/samsquire/society).

I am interested of distributed systems, parallelism, concurrency, lockfree algorithms, database architecture and internals, programming language design, algorithms and data structures. You shall find various straightforward, simple implementations of various algorithms on my Github profile. Change the dropdown types field to 'Sources' to see things I created.

I wrote a [toy amd64 in Python and JIT compiler in C](https://github.com/samsquire/compiler) and the [beginnings of a browser engine](https://github.com/samsquire/browser) 

Some highlights - I implemented a [three way merge diff algorithm based on Myers algorithm](HTTPS://GitHub.com/samsquire/text-diff). A [distributed pseudo multimodal keystore database](HTTPS://GitHub.com/samsquire/hash-db) and a [mazzle build server](HTTPS://devops-pipeline.com). I also implemented a [merkle CRDT](HTTPS://GitHub.com/samsquire/merkle-crdt) and part of the [YATA text merging algorithm](HTTPS://GitHub.com/samsquire/yata).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [ideas4](https://github.com/samsquire/ideas4) and [eventually-consistent-mesh](https://github.com/samsquire/eventually-consistent-mesh)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking for remote work
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to talk about my ideas
